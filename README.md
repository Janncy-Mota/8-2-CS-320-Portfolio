How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are several ways that come to mind when it come to mind when it comes to ensuring the functionality of my own code. One is basically just reviewing and doing what we did by Unit testing specific pieces of the program, making sure that each of them work this way. The other is by consistently compiling and making sure that there are no errors and that everything is working well. Testing as a whole is helpful and made me realize like we talked about last week that it needs to happen to save money and make sure there are no bugs because the errors even a small bug could cause are catastrophic.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The ways that I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program is by speaking directly with users in order to understand what their needs are. Making a prototype as well to gather information and having other users test in order to perform specific tasks with the software. This way we can see where it is that the issues are coming from.

How do I approach designing software?

First thing I would do is try to understand what the problem is before I even write the next line of code, that means compiling and making sure that everything is running smoothly. Adding comments is essential too, in order to let the other person who picks up the program know what's going on and the changes that were done. THis helps out greatly especially when working with a team.
